# Stepping Stones

This is an application to score a card game called Stepping Stones. It's a whist-based game, resembling some others such as Oh Hell, and it's called 7s Up and Down by others in my family. We call it Stepping Stones because "it's a poor man's bridge".

## Notes

Should be a pretty standard react app. Install the dependencies, set it live, and you're golden.

Heavily a work-in-progress. I'll put issue tracking live soon to track what all needs to be done.

## Game Rules

Rules to come, but getting the application is my number one priority for now.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
